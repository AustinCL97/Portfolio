# Portfolio
First App Academy Capstone project, will eventually be a full portfolio. 

This is my first Capstone project for HTML/CSS in the App Academy bootcamp. I plan to grow and develop this website as I gain more knowledge and skills, allowing for anyone viewing this to see my progress in real time. By the end of my courses I intend for this to be a fully fleshed out portfolio website, showcasing all my current and planned projects.
